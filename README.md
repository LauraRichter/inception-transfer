# inception-transfer

Examples around the topic of transfer learning using Tensorflow, by retraining the Inception model. [Inception-v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) is a CNN image classification model that was trained using [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/) data, for the Large Visual Recognition Challenge. 

* Example 1: **Transfer learning** - Transfer learning from the Inception model
* Example 2: **Building a CNN** - Building an Inception style model from scratch
* Example 3: **What are these convolutions you speak of?** - Playing with convolutions
